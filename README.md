# ***Tic Tac Toe - RN***

 this doc is work in progress

### Overview
This React Native application is designed to help folks stay organized - enforces a clear separation of concerns. It utilizes modern React patterns, TypeScript for strong type safety, and Expo to deliver a smooth and efficient development experience.

### Architecture

	•	Component-Based Architecture: Built with reusable UI components and well-defined interfaces to promote maintainability and scalability.
	•	Context Pattern: Manages global state for app configuration and settings through a clean, centralized context layer.
	•	Custom Hooks: Encapsulates core logic for sounds, settings, and game utilities, ensuring better reusability and cleaner components.
	•	Screen-Based Navigation: Implements stack navigation using React Navigation for a structured and intuitive user flow.
	•	Type-Safe Development: Leverages full TypeScript integration to provide robust type safety and improved developer experience.

### Minimax Algo Plus

```typescript
// Minimax Core Logic:
1. Base Cases:
   - Terminal states (win/loss/draw)
   - Maximum depth reached (difficulty control)

2. Recursive Cases:
   - Maximizing player: Choose highest value move
   - Minimizing player: Choose lowest value move

3. Optimizations:
   - Depth penalty for wins/losses (prefer quicker wins)
   - Random selection from equal-value moves
   - Depth limiting for difficulty levels
```

### basic State Management

```typescript
// Board Representation:
- 1D array of 9 cells [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
- Maps to 3x3 grid:
  [0][1][2]
  [3][4][5]
  [6][7][8]

// Win Condition Detection:
- Horizontal lines: [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8]
- Vertical lines: [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8]
- Diagonal lines: [0,4,8], [2,4,6]
```

## Styles

Component-Level Styles: Each component has its own .styles.ts file
Global Constants: Colors and shared values in /utils
Responsive Design: Dynamic sizing based on screen dimensions
Theme Consistency: Consistent color palette throughout
