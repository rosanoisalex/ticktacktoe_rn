# ***Tic Tac Toe - RN***

 this doc is work in progress

### Overview
This React Native application follows a well-structured, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The project is built using modern React patterns with TypeScript for type safety and Expo for simplified development workflow.

### Architecture

Component-Based Architecture: Reusable UI components with clear interfaces
Context Pattern: Global state management for settings and app configuration
Custom Hooks: Encapsulated logic for sounds, settings, and game utilities
Screen-Based Navigation: Stack navigation with React Navigation
Type-Safe Development: Comprehensive TypeScript integration

### Minimax Algo plus

```typescript
// Minimax Core Logic:
1. Base Cases:
   - Terminal states (win/loss/draw)
   - Maximum depth reached (difficulty control)

2. Recursive Cases:
   - Maximizing player: Choose highest value move
   - Minimizing player: Choose lowest value move

3. Optimizations:
   - Depth penalty for wins/losses (prefer quicker wins)
   - Random selection from equal-value moves
   - Depth limiting for difficulty levels
```

### basic State Management

```typescript
// Board Representation:
- 1D array of 9 cells [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
- Maps to 3x3 grid:
  [0][1][2]
  [3][4][5]
  [6][7][8]

// Win Condition Detection:
- Horizontal lines: [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8]
- Vertical lines: [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8]
- Diagonal lines: [0,4,8], [2,4,6]
```

## Styles

Component-Level Styles: Each component has its own .styles.ts file
Global Constants: Colors and shared values in /utils
Responsive Design: Dynamic sizing based on screen dimensions
Theme Consistency: Consistent color palette throughout
